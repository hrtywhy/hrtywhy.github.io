Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Hartoyo Wahyu, a practitioner in the field of Information Technology, currently fousing in IT Security or Cyber Security. I want to clarify that I'm not trying to come across as preachy to all of my fellow readers. The main purpose behind this short note is simply to share knowledge about the world I work in day-to-day, and of course, to serve as a personal reminder for myself. This is because humans, as individuals, have a tendency to forget or <i>nisyan</i> (pelupa), which is a natural part of us.

There's always more beyond what meets the eye, just like there are more layers in the sky above. Therefore, what I'm writing here might not hold any immediate significance for my fellow readers who are taking the time to read this lil snippet. Nevertheless, the key point is that we can all learn from and share with each other. I firmly believe that knowledge becomes a blessing when it's shared to enlighten others.

Warm regards,

Hartoyo Wahyu
