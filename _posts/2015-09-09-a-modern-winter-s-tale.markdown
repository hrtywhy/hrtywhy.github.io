Curious to see what Shakespeare would sound like set in modern slang, I translated line 1–64 of The Winter’s Tale Act IV Scene IV into this “new vernacular.”

Here’s what I came up with:

---

**Florizel:** Damn shauty, you be lookin’ like ma trap queen, sportin’ dem fresh threads ’n’ all. You know dem boys like to hang around this sheep shearing ish.

**Perdita:** Boiii, you doing too much, please, you gotta chick blushin’ right here. You on fleek and over here lookin’ like some poor cinderella ish. You be hella swag.

**Florizel:** I fell in love with you the first time I saw you with the fam down by dem fields.
