I was sitting in my first EE16A discussion when as an icebreaker we had to write group stories. I was trying to come up with an idea, but was at a loss for words…

I looked around and saw that somehow my class had turned into a zoo. The students transformed into various animals…

The girl next to me had transformed into a penguin while my TA snarled at me in a ferocious tiger form. Luckily…

I had taken an animal fighting Decal the semester before, so I knew exactly what to do. The first step according to my class was…

to go up to the tiger and offer it a tuna sandwich. Ever since that day, we heave been best friends who go on toboggan rides in the winter and discuss philosophy in an easy to under, comic-like format.
