It is time to amend the Electoral College. Any system that has failed 5 times out 58 is broken. Democracy should represent people, not states. If more people live in urban areas, then urban areas should have more voting power.

Besides, the electoral college doesn’t shift attention away from “big” states to “small” states. It simply shifts them to a few “battleground states”. We can fix this. It doesn’t even need a Constitutional Amendment. It could be done with the agreement of enough states with over 50% of the electoral college voting power. Check out the [National Popular Vote Interstate Compact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact).
