Experience from a friend on Election Day 2016:

> “I spent all day campaigning outside the polls. This isn’t unusual, I’m always involved with some kind of political cause or candidate. What WAS unusual was the sort of people who turned out to vote in this election. I usually see a lot of retirees, government employees, and white-collar workers. This time, though, was a completely different crowd. They showed up covered in drywall dust or smelling like fertilizer, wearing Carhartt jackets and mechanics’ coveralls. They drove their big rigs and pickups right up to the poll and asked how to vote because they weren’t familiar with the process. The crowd today was unmistakably composed of pissed-off, working-class white people, and they turned up in huge numbers.”
