I wrote a tutorial on how to get started using the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/) to build your own modules and decentralized blockchain applications. This tutorial was first walked through during a live workshop at the SF Blockchain Week Epicenter event (co-hosted by [Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/)!) and was then adapted into a follow along text tutorial. We will likely be releasing a video walkthrough soon!

In the tutorial, we build a ‚Äúnameservice‚Äù, a mapping of strings to other strings (similar to [Namecoin](https://namecoin.org/), [ENS](https://ens.domains/), or [Handshake](https://handshake.org/)), in which to buy the name, the buyer has to pay the current owner more than the current owner paid to buy it! We call the application Nameshake üòâ

The tutorial is still a work in progress. If you have any feedback or issues, please let us know through the Github issues page. Please enjoy!
