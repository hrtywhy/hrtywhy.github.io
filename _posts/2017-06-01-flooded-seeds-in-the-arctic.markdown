I came across this article yesterday and couldn’t help but laugh at the irony that this vault was designed for the express purpose of being able to survive a terrible global calamity (such as nuclear war for example). Yet, it somehow isn’t equipped to handle the very real global calamity that’s actually happening RIGHT NOW (climate change)??

But the Global Seed Vault, buried in a mountain deep inside the Arctic circle, has been breached after global warming produced extraordinary temperatures over the winter, sending meltwater gushing into the entrance tunnel.</p></blockquote>
