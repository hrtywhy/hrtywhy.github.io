While surfing YouTube a few days ago, I somehow found myself watching deleted scenes from the Tarantino movie Pulp Fiction. I came across this one, where I noticed something that perked my ears.

At about time 2:36, Winston “The Wolf” Wolf’s girlfriend calls him “Señor Lobo”.

This caught my attention, because just a few minutes earlier, I had rewatched the scene from earlier in the movie with Butch’s taxi ride and his conversation with the driver … Esmeralda Villa ***Lobos***.

(Start at 1:57)

The scene focuses on her name as part of their conversation. And in fact, a few seconds later, Esmeralda asks Butch what his name means, drawing particular attention to the meaning of names. And would you have it, turns out the name *Lobos* does in fact mean “Wolf” in Spanish.

Now this might just be a completely random coincidence that two characters have last names that mean the same thing. But then again, this is Pulp Fiction we’re talking about, a movie famously notorious for its many hidden easter eggs!

I do find it odd that I couldn’t find any single mention on the internet about this, given the insane number of videos and articles covering the most random easter eggs in Tarantino’s movies!
