Check out this whitepaper presentation I recently gave on [IOTA](https://iotatoken.com)â€™s revolutionary new block-less distributed ledger called the Tangle. The scalable and lightweight nature of the Tangle makes possible the transfer of value without any fees and the removal of the dichotomy between blockchain users and miners. This will potentially open up a world of opportunity for IOT and enable micro-transactions.
