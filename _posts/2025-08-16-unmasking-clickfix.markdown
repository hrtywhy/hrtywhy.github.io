In the evolving world of cybersecurity threats, *ClickFix* is one of the clearest examples of why people are often the weakest link in the security chain.

Unlike sophisticated zero-day exploits that target software flaws, ClickFix manipulates human trust in familiar web elements like CAPTCHAs, video conferencing login pages, and “Fix it” prompts. By mimicking familiar elements like CAPTCHAs and “Fix it” pop-ups, ClickFix tricks users into executing harmful code themselves.

From late 2024 into 2025, security teams from various vendor or intelligence team like **Splunk**, **Darktrace**, **Unit42**, **Sekoia** or whatever have all documented the rise of ClickFix campaigns. These attacks have been observed delivering:

- **Lumma Stealer** and other credential theft malware
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)** for spying and persistence
- **Ransomware** like *Epsilon Red*, delivered via malicious `.HTA` files

It’s a reminder that **sometimes the attacker doesn’t need to break in — they just need you to open the door yourself**.

# Conclusion

The Marijuana PHP Backdoor employs advanced evasion tactics, such as obfuscation, payload embedding, and WAF bypassing, making it a significant threat. To protect systems from such attacks, it's crucial to regularly patch vulnerabilities, particularly in PHP-based applications, and implement robust security configurations, such as proper input sanitization and WAF tuning. Additionally, swift identification of indicators and proactive incident response can greatly reduce the impact of these attacks. Staying vigilant and up-to-date with security best practices is essential to defending against similar threats.
