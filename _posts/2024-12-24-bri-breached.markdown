As data becomes the new oil, its trade has drawn immense attention globally. Data is vital in today’s interconnected world, often being shared among various organizations, sometimes with or without consent. This rampant sharing marks your digital presence more than you might realize. As a result, your digital persona could be traded, leading to unsolicited messages or prompts tailored to your interests.

In this blog, we unfold the story of one of Indonesia's largest banks, [BRI](https://bri.co.id), and its alleged data breach incident.

On December 18, 2024, Bashe Ransomware claimed of a data breach involving BRI.co.id surfaced on a threat actor's portal and reported by Threat Intelligence Platforms. The portal featured a few sample datasets to substantiate the breach’s authenticity.

Upon review, it was found that the allegedly leaked data appeared unreliable. Portions of it were already available in public digital libraries. This raised questions about the genuineness of the breach and cast doubt on the threat actor’s claims.

Since the data could not be proven to be true and to gain more evidence, I reached out to the threat actor under the pretext of purchasing the data. Below are excerpts from my conversations via Telegram:

Shortly after, the breach claims gained significant media attention, becoming viral. True to the typical response, BRI denied any compromise of its systems, citing internal investigations.

However, the threat actor escalated the situation, extending the release date of the alleged data to December 24, 2024, at 18:00 UTC. The actor also claimed to have infected and locked the victim’s infrastructure, adding to the urgency of the situation.

To Be Continued:
As the situation unfolds, the validity of the threat actor’s claims remains uncertain. Stay tuned for updates as we continue to monitor this developing story.
