FLARE-VM is a purpose-built virtual machine created & maintained by FireEye, a cybersecurity company. It comes pre-configured with a variety of tools, software, and scripts commonly used for malware analysis and reverse engineering tasks. These tools include disassemblers, debuggers, memory analysis tools, and various utilities for analyzing and dissecting malware samples.
It provides a controlled and isolated environment for security analysts to safely analyze potentially malicious software without risk to their own systems. It‚Äôs a valuable resource for those working in the field of cybersecurity and malware analysis to better understand and defend against threats.

[Flare-VM GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm)

download chrome for smooth experience and download flare

Copy link address for [install.ps1](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm/blob/main/install.ps1)

follow the installation setup on documentation such as
```Unblock-File .\install.ps1``` and ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force``` and then you can execute the installer ```.\install.ps1```

dont forget to change network adapter on VirtualBox to Host Only

Flare VM setup completed! üñ•Ô∏è
