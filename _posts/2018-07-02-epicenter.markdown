When I first got involved with blockchain, I used to listen to a lot of [Epicenter](https://epicenter.tv/) podcast episodes to learn about the tech and the space. I always wanted to be a guest one day on the show. Guess that hasn’t happened yet, but instead I just leapfrogged and joined Epicenter as a Co-host! Super excited to learn from and challenge guests in the future!

Check out my first few episodes on [Cardano](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DFYBb_zOpc), [Scilla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPqnK2iNGZo), and the [K Framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFOnoqAplAY)!

P.S. Don’t worry, [Conspiratus](https://conspirat.us) will still exist as well!
