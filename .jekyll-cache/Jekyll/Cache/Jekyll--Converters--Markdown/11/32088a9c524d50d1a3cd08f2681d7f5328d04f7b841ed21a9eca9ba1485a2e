I"Î<p>While ruminating on my <a href="/gasdrop.html">Gasdrop idea</a> from a few months ago, I thought of a pretty funny and somewhat devious method for Ethereum smart contract developers to monetize their smart contracts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>In your contract execution, make the caller create a bunch of GasTokens (if you donâ€™t know what GasToken is, <a href="https://gastoken.io/">read their website first</a>) in the contractâ€™s name.</li>
  <li>Allow yourself to sell those GasTokens for a profit! (<a href="https://uniswap.info/token/0x0000000000b3f879cb30fe243b4dfee438691c04">Thereâ€™s a market on Uniswap!</a>)
Yep, itâ€™s that simple!</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, of course, GasToken isnâ€™t perfect; you end up losing some value to the miners. It would be better to just require users to pay a fee in order to execute your contract. And this probably works well for contracts where people are already sending money to the contract and you can scrape some off the top (like Uniswapâ€™s 0.3% fee).</p>

<p>But for many contracts where people arenâ€™t sending money to it, requiring them to attach value to their contract call would likely add a lot of friction and would make users somewhat uneasy. However, by using the GasToken model, this cost gets hidden away is the increased gas usage of the contract call! And letâ€™s be real, people donâ€™t really have an intuitive sense of how much gas a contract <em>should</em> be using, so artificially increasing it a bit would probably be close to zero added friction!</p>

<p>Should people use this? I donâ€™t know. But itâ€™s a fun concept, and it would be kind of interesting if someone does!</p>
