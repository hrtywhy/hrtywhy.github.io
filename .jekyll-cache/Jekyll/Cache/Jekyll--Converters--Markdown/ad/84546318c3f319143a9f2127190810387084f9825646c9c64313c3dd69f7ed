I"ñ<p>When I first got involved with blockchain, I used to listen to a lot of <a href="https://epicenter.tv/">Epicenter</a> podcast episodes to learn about the tech and the space. I always wanted to be a guest one day on the show. Guess that hasnâ€™t happened yet, but instead I just leapfrogged and joined Epicenter as a Co-host! Super excited to learn from and challenge guests in the future!</p>

<p>Check out my first few episodes on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DFYBb_zOpc">Cardano</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPqnK2iNGZo">Scilla</a>, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFOnoqAplAY">K Framework</a>!</p>

<p>P.S. Donâ€™t worry, <a href="https://conspirat.us">Conspiratus</a> will still exist as well!</p>
