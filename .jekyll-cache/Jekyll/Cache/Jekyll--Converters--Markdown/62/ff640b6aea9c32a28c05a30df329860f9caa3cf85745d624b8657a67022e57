<p>Besides, the electoral college doesn’t shift attention away from “big” states to “small” states. It simply shifts them to a few “battleground states”. We can fix this. It doesn’t even need a Constitutional Amendment. It could be done with the agreement of enough states with over 50% of the electoral college voting power.
