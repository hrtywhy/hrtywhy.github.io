<p>For an introduction to blockchains and why theyâ€™re exciting, read this three part articles series by my friend <a href="https://medium.com/u/56f55b4f0c2b">Ashley Lannquist</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest the UC Berkeley Blockchain Fundamentals Decal course that I co-designed.</p>

<p>All the materials are online here: <a href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/decal/fa17/fund/">Blockchain Fundamental Decal</a></p>

<p>The YouTube playlist is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLSONl1AVlZNXVI1dobdDrwv2hhIgemJuA">Blockchain Fundamentals Decal Playlist</a></p>

<h4 id="im-a-developer-how-do-i-get-into-blockchain-application-development">Iâ€™m a developer. How do I get into blockchain application development?</h4>

<p>For the moment, I would suggest focusing on Ethereum. Iâ€™m not convinced that their paradigm is optimal, however, for now until we release more material from Cosmos Academy on how to develop using Tendermint / Cosmos, Ethereum is the best starting point to hit the ground running.</p>

<p>I highly suggest using the following handbook I created during my time at ConsenSys</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://sunnya97.gitbooks.io/a-beginner-s-guide-to-ethereum-and-dapp-developme/content/">Introduction Â· A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Ethereum and Dapp Development</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, if you prefer a more guided course, two of my friends, <a href="https://medium.com/u/22faf93c75c2">Ali Mousa</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/u/f720d66bf162">Collin Chin</a> from Blockchain at Berkeley, created this course (note it has a cost of $150):</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know. <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/bitcoin-delusion-conquer-world/547187/">This article</a> does a decent job of at least laying out some of the theories.</p>

<h4 id="should-i-invest-in-">Should I invest in â€¦?</h4>

<p>I donâ€™t give investment advice. To be honest, you probably donâ€™t want my advice anyways, I donâ€™t know much about trading and stuff. Feel free to ask me what I think of the technicals of a protocol though!</p>

<p>I accept Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Ethereum Classic. And if youâ€™re super lame, plain old Venmo works too ;)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>BTC / BCH:</strong> 3NT7b6KNs1kTBJu5fSap1mLGrGQR3ebDxD</li>
  <li><strong>ETH / ETC:</strong> 0xe17A702c7264AB8602e7fDf4d89d8045301E80b9</li>
  <li><strong>Venmo:</strong> @sunnya97
And before anyone mentions it, yes, Iâ€™m aware of the possibility of replay attacks on ETH and ETC if Iâ€™m using the same address. I know how to deal with it :)</li>
