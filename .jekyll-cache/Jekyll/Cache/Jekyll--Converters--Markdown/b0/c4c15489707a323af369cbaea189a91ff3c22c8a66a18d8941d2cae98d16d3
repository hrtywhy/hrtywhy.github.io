<p>One day, while randomly surfing the Berkeley EECS page, I came across a post from some random person advertising that they would pay half of TC Disrupt ticket if we advertise for them. Interested, I followed up and met Michael and Kenneth, the co-founders of PIF. And from there, my roommates and I ended up interning for them at TechCrunch Disrupt. However, to cut over the noise of the other 500 startups there, we realized we had to do something different. And thatâ€™s why we trolled TechCrunch (yes, we almost got kicked out!). Read about it <a href="https://medium.com/the-pif-chronicles/how-we-hacked-techcrunch-disrupt-f62f9f9f8dd7">here in Michaelâ€™s article</a>.</p>
