I"¡<p>I believe that every person should have a fair shot at achieving the American dream, but that every personâ€™s achievement should be the product of their own work, merit, and skills. To this end, we must increase equality of opportunity and create a society where no one is discriminated against due to their race, religion, creed, or gender, but rather judged and rewarded for what they offer to their fellow man.</p>

<p>The governmentâ€™s job in such a society is to protect the peopleâ€™s ability to act freely, create change, and live without fear. This means protecting their rights and liberties, and not over encroaching upon them. When the government starts controlling what people can say (which includes mass surveillance), taking from its people in order to fund its unregulated spending habits, and interfering in the economic markets beyond their right, it undermines the free society it seeks to maintain.</p>
