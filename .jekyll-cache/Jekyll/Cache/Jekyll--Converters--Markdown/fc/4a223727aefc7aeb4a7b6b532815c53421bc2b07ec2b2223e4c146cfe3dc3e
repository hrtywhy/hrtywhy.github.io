I"¶<p>I donâ€™t care whom youâ€™re supporting, everyone should be scared how much control and influence a completely private organization has over the exposure that their chosen political candidates receive. Itâ€™s not a democracy when a single entity wields the authority to silence whom they want based on arbitrary rules that they set themselves. No candidate on the ballot in all 50 states should be denied a podium at the debates.</p>
