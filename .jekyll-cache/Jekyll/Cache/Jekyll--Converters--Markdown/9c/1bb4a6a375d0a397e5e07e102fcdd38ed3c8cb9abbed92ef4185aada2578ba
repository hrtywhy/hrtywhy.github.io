I"<p>At UC Berkeley, thereâ€™s this super awesome program called Decals, in which students can teach for-credit courses (with the backing of a professor). I had co-taught the <a href="https://blockchain.berkeley.edu/courses/fall-2019-fundamentals-decal/">Cryptocurrency Decal</a> for 2 semesters, which helped seed the Blockchain at Berkeley organization. After two semesters teaching it, I wanted to hand it off to a new generation of teachers. But I still really enjoyed teaching. And while the cryptocurrency decal was a large scale project with over 100 students, multiple teachers, etc, I wanted an opportunity to solo-teach a smaller, more intimate class.</p>

<p>The semester prior, I had written a paper comparing Switzerland and Belgium (you can read that essay <a href="/switzerland-and-belgium-two-approaches-to-a-multilingual-state.html">here</a>), and after that I was a bit obsessed with the country. And so I decided to make that the topic of my class! I found a professor in the Institute of European Studies department, <a href="https://ies.berkeley.edu/jeroen-dewulf">Professor Jeroen DeWulf</a>, who graciously agreed to back the course. And we were off!</p>

<p>So in Fall 2017, I taught the Switzerland Decal! Now, if you know a bit about my personal life timeline, you might notice that thereâ€™s something a bit odd about that. I had dropped out of university right before my Fall 2017 semester started! Which is true, but I had signed up to teach it the previous semester, when I was still a student and hadnâ€™t planned on dropping out yet. So I taught the Decal class, as not a student ðŸ˜„</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s a link the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tlnqaZ2Zo6ICmKYxkFZh-RbXQHyFxNpnejFA_0skcyo/edit">syllabus for the course</a>. On August 1 this year (Swiss National Day), I finally took the time to edit and upload (and even re-record one of) the lecture recordings from the course, which you can watch below.</p>

<p>Also, if any current UC Berkeley student (or any other school that has a similar program) would like to restart this course, let me know, happy to share all my lecture materials!</p>

<p>P.S. Unfortunately the last lecture of the course wasnâ€™t recorded, but in that we played Jeopardy! And the team that won, didnâ€™t have to write a final paper! Never seen students try so hard in a game of in-class Jeopardy!</p>
